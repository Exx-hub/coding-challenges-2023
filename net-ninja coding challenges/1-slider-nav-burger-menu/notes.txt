burger menu

-create a div, add classname of menu-button

-inside div create three divs or spans
-these will be your three bars for the burger menu

-can use checkbox and state if using react to get checked property or not.
-in this case i used no checkbox, just adding classname active when clicked. (using javascript)
-this will cause the bars to change behavior

-when active or checked,

1st bar will rotate and move down a bit
3rd bar will rotate and move up a bit
2nd bar will be hidden


forms and "X" if you will


-now when active, a sidebar will be shown by making opacity to 1 and transform translate x

-when burger is cliced also add "show" classname to the slide-menu
-when show is added, opacity will become 1 and slidemenu will slide from the left offscreen
