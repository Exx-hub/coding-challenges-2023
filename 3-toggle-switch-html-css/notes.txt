CHECKBOX HIDDEN, BUT CLICKING IS WORKING VIA THE SWITCH
-hide the input checkbox
-need to wrap the toggleswitch in a label and add the htmlFor attribute, and id same id to the input
-this will associate the switch to the checkbox, activating the checkbox even if it is hidden, and the switch is the one being clicked


-style the label as a container
-create a div or p as the button
-check if checkbox is checked thru css, add css to translate the button left to right with transition
